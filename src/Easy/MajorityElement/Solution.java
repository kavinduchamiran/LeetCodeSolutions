        // You can always use a HashMap to keep the count but that would require extra O(n) space

        // to solve this in O(1) space and O(n) time, Since the problem states that there will always
        // be a majority element i.e. no 2 elements with the same highest count, we can use
        // the Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_majority_vote_algorithm
        // it works like this

        // you initially consider some element in the nums array to be the majority element
        // you iterate from left to right, and everytime you come across that element, you increment a counter by 1
        // when you come across a different element, you decrement the counter by 1
        // if the counter becomes 0, that means we have seen the same number of elements of 2 different elements
        // that means considering what we have seen so far in the array, no elements are candidates for majority

        // when the counter hits 0, we consider the next element in the array as the majority
        // and we keep doing this until we reach the end of the array
        // since the problem states that there will always be a majority,
        // when we come to the end of the array, counter must be greater than 0, and whatever value
        // we considered to be the result, is the actual majority

        // the gotcha is, the majority element occurs more frequently than the rest of the array combined!
